            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
               My name is Czicken and I'm a <span id="age"></span>-year-old 
               amateur artist based in the Czech republic, who also dabbles in a bit of coding. 
               The majority of my work is digital but there might be a couple attempts at traditional art mixed in too.
               I use Photoshop, which has been my preferred program for 6 years now.
            </p>
            <p>
                My portfolio features all my artwork dating back as far as 2020. 
                My old art is a bit... lacking but I personally believe that as embarrassing as old drawings can be,
                it's nice to see the journey of how one developed their current style.
